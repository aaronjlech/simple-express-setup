# Simple Express Setup


## Getting starting:

clone the repo and set the name of the project
`git clone git@github.com:aaronjlech/simple-express-setup.git new-project`
(new-project should be the name of your current project)

Run the following next
`git remote remove origin`
(this removes your express setup repository as the origin so we can generate a new repository for our new project)

next run
`npm install`
this will install all of our node modules locally

Now we should be ready to go!

## Happy Coding
